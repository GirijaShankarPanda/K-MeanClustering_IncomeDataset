# K-Means Clustering :
## [[ Income Dataset ]](https://github.com/GirijaShankarPanda/K-MeanClustering_IncomeDataset/blob/main/Income.csv)
*This is a simple project on **K-Means Clustering**, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning.*

> "It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties."

### *K-Means clustering Algorithm:*
*The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:*
- Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.
- Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster.*

*In this project a dataset, that comprises of Age and Income of some random people is taken and the unlabeled dataset are grouped into different clusters by using the algorithm of K-Means Clustering. Here, the value of K=3, where K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process.* 
> ### Goal: 
***Our goal in this project is to find the graph between K-Means ans Sum of Squared Error (SSE) and observe the relation between them.***
